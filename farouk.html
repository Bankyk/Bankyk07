    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP.
         It allows you to declare the 
        libraries your project depends on and it will 
        manage (install/update) them for you.
    </p>

    <h1><strong>Dependency management</strong></h1>

    <p>Composer is <strong> not</strong> a package manager in the same sense as Yum or Apt are. Yes, 
        it deals with "packages" or libraries, 
        but it manages them on a per-project basis, installing them in a directory 
        (e.g. <button>vendor</button>) inside your project. By default, it does not install anything globally. 
        Thus, it is a dependency manager. It does however support a "global" project for 
        convenience via the global command.

        This idea is not new and Composer is strongly inspired by node's npm and ruby's bundler.
    </p>
    <p>Suppose:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>You have a project that depends on a number of libraries.</li>
        <li>Some of those libraries depend on other libraries.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Composer:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Enables you to declare the libraries you depend on.</li>
        <li>Finds out which versions of which packages can and need to be installed, 
            and installs them (meaning it downloads them into your project).</li>
        <li>You can update all your dependencies in one command.</li>

        <p>See the Basic usage chapter for more details on declaring dependencies.</p>
    </ol>


    <h1>system requirements#</h5>
    <p>
        Composer in its latest version requires PHP 7.2.5 to run. A long-term-support version (2.2.x) still offers support for PHP 5.3.2+ in case you<br> 
        are stuck with a legacy PHP version. A few sensitive php settings and compile flags are also required, but when using the installer<br>
        you will be warned about any incompatibilities.<br><br>

        Composer needs several supporting applications to work effectively, making the process of handling package dependencies more<br> 
        efficient. For decompressing files, Composer relies on tools like <button>z</button> (or <button>7zz</button>), <button>gzip</button>, <button>tar</button> <button>unrar</button>, <button>unzip</button> and <button>xz</button>. As for version<br> 
        control systems, Composer integrates seamlessly with Fossil, Git, Mercurial, Perforce and Subversion, thereby ensuring the application's<br> 
        smooth operation and management of library repositories. Before using Composer, ensure that these dependencies are correctly<br> 
        installed on your system.

        Composer is multi-platform and we strive to make it run equally well on Windows, Linux and macOS.

    <h1>
        Installation - Linux / Unix / macOS#
    </h1>
    <h4>
        Downloading the Composer Executable#
    </h4>
    <p>
        Composer offers a convenient installer that you can execute directly from the command line. Feel free to download this file or review it on<br> 
        GitHub if you wish to know more about the inner workings of the installer. The source is plain PHP.

        There are, in short, two ways to install Composer. Locally as part of your project, or globally as a system wide executable.

    </p>

    <h6>
        locally#
    </h6>

    <p>
        To install Composer locally, run the installer in your project directory. See the Download page for instructions.

        The installer will check a few PHP settings and then download <button>composer.phar</button> to your working directory. This file is the Composer<br> 
        binary. It is a PHAR (PHP archive), which is an archive format for PHP which can be run on the command line, amongst other things.

        Now run <button>php composer.phar</button> in order to run Composer.

        You can install Composer to a specific directory by using the <button>--install-dir</button> option and additionally (re)name it as well using the<br> 
        <button>--filename</button> option. When running the installer when following the Download page instructions add the following parameters:
    </p>

    <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.842);"> php composer-setup.php --install-dir=bin --filename=composer</p>
    <p>Now run <button>php bin/composer</button> in order to run Composer.</p>

    <h4>Globally#</h4>
    <p>
        You can place the Composer PHAR anywhere you wish. If you put it in a directory that is part of your <button>PATH</button>, you can access it globally<br>.
         On Unix systems you can even make it executable and invoke it without directly using the <button> php</button> interpreter.

        After running the installer following the Download page instructions you can run this to move composer.phar to a directory that is in your path:

        
    </p>

    <p style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.904);">mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer</p>
